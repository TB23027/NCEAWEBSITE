                <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
                <a>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
                    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such 
                    as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
                    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
                    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
                    paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML 
                    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
                    Tags such as < img > and < input > directly introduce 
                    content into the page. Other tags such as < p > surround 
                    and provide information about document text and may 
                    include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not 
                    display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the 
                    content of the page.</a>

                <h1>HTML Versions</h1>
                <h2>HTML - 1990</h2>
                <a>The first publicly available description of HTML was a 
                document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the 
                Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991</a>
                <h2>HTML 2 - November 24, 1995</h2>
                <a>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities</a>
                <h2>HTML 3 - January 14, 1997</h2>
                <a>HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. 
                It was the first version developed and standardized 
                exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML
                Working Group on September 12, 1996.</a>
                <h2>HTML 4 - December 18, 1997</h2>
                <a>HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:</a>
                <ul>    
                    <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
                    <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
                    <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>HTML 5 - October 28, 2014</h2>
                <a>HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</a>
                <h2>November 1, 2016</h2>
                <a>HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</a>
                <h2>December 14, 2017</h2>
                <a>HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation</a>
